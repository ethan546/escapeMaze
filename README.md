# escapeMaze

How to run the game:
Just run the master.py script. This file works independently, and the other scripts are just there to show the building process before we put everything together.


How to play:
Use the directional arrows to move the player.
Use the mouse to shoot. 

Your goal is to escape through the maze without getting killed by all the traps and monsters!
Shoot monsters to temporarily stun them!
