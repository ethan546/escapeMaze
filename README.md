# escapeMaze

How to run the game:
Just run the master.py script. This file works independently, and the other scripts are just there to show the building process before we put everything together.


How to play:
Use the directional arrows to move the player.
Use the mouse to shoot. 
Press 'q' if you need to quit the game.

Your goal is to escape through the maze without getting killed by all the traps and monsters!
Shoot monsters to temporarily stun them!

Note: not all non-master scripts have current versions of their respective classes, since many of the classes were modified in the master script so they would work better with one another.
